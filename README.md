# Bitcoin To Satoshi
I start the project using this nice [boilerplate](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-chrome-extension-boilerplate)

## How to dev ?
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Load the dev folder in chrome extension explorer.
You can now edit the code in app / chrome folder and it will be automatically live reloaded :tada:
